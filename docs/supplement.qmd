# Spatial Analysis of TB Notification Rates

## Spatial Autocorrelation

Spatial autocorrelation is a statistical measure that evaluates the degree to which similar values are located near each other in geographic space. It helps us understand if high or low values of a variable (e.g., TB notification rates) cluster together in a pattern that is different from what would be expected if the underlying spatial processes were random.

### Expected TB Cases Calculation

The expected TB cases for each area in a year, denoted as $E_{i,j}$, can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
E_{i,j} = P_{i,j} \times \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{226} O_{j}}{\sum_{i=1}^{226} P_{j}}
$$

Where:
- $E_{i,j}$ signifies the expected number of TB cases in the ith area for year j.
- $P_{i,j}$ represents the population in the ith area for year j.
- $\sum_{i=1}^{226} O_{j}$ denotes the total observed TB cases across all areas for year j.
- $\sum_{i=1}^{226} P_{j}$ is the total population across all areas for year j.
- `i` ranges from 1 to 226, corresponding to the individual communes.
- `j` ranges from 2012 to 2021, covering the years of the study.

The spatial Standardized Mortality Risk (SMR) is calculated as:

$$
SMR_{i,j} = \frac{O_{i,j}}{E_{i,j}}
$$

## Moran’s I Statistic

The Global Moran’s I statistic is defined as:

$$
I = \frac{N}{W} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N} w_{ij} \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})(x_j - \bar{x})}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$

Where:
- `N` is the number of spatial units indexed by i and j.
- $x_i$ and $x_j$ are the observations at locations i and j.
- $\bar{x}$ is the mean of all observations.
- $w_{ij}$ is the spatial weight between locations i and j.
- `W` is the sum of all spatial weights, $\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N} w_{ij}$.

A positive Moran's I indicates clustering of similar values, while a negative value suggests dispersion.

### Interpretation of Moran's I and p-values

A positive Moran's I value indicates that regions with similar TB rates are clustered together, while a negative value suggests that high and low rates are interspersed, indicating dispersion. The Moran's I statistic is typically accompanied by a p-value, which assesses the significance of the autocorrelation observed:

- **p-value < 0.05**: Indicates that the observed spatial pattern is statistically significant, meaning there is less than a 5% likelihood that this pattern could be due to random chance. This suggests that the clustering or dispersion is a real feature of the data.
- **p-value >= 0.05**: Suggests that the spatial pattern could be random, meaning the observed clustering or dispersion might not be statistically significant.

## Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA)

LISA statistics identify local clusters and spatial outliers. The categories of clusters are:

- **High-High (HH)**: An area with high TB rates surrounded by areas with similarly high rates. This indicates a hotspot.
- **Low-Low (LL)**: An area with low TB rates surrounded by areas with similarly low rates. This is often referred to as a cold spot.
- **High-Low (HL)**: An area with high TB rates surrounded by areas with low rates. This suggests an outlier where the area significantly differs from its neighbors.
- **Low-High (LH)**: An area with low TB rates surrounded by areas with high rates. This also indicates an outlier, contrasting sharply with surrounding areas.

The LISA for a location i is given by:

$$
I_i = \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{s^2} \sum_{j=1}^{N} w_{ij} (x_j - \bar{x})
$$

Where `s^2` is the variance of the observations. These local statistics are crucial for identifying areas where the pattern of spatial association is significantly different from the global pattern indicated by Moran’s I.
