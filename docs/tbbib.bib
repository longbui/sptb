  abstract = {There has been much recent interest in Bayesian image analysis, including such topics as removal of blur and noise, detection of object boundaries, classification of textures, and reconstruction of two- or three-dimensional scenes from noisy lower-dimensional views. Perhaps the most straightforward task is that of image restoration, though it is often suggested that this is an area of relatively minor practical importance. The present paper argues the contrary, since many problems in the analysis of spatial data can be interpreted as problems of image restoration. Furthermore, the amounts of data involved allow routine use of computer intensive methods, such as the Gibbs sampler, that are not yet practicable for conventional images. Two examples are given, one in archeology, the other in epidemiology. These are preceded by a partial review of pixel-based Bayesian image analysis.},

  abstract = {Disease mapping is the area of epidemiology that estimates the spatial pattern in disease risk over an extended geographical region, so that areas with elevated risk levels can be identified. Bayesian hierarchical models are typically used in this context, which represent the risk surface using a combination of available covariate data and a set of spatial random effects. These random effects are included to model any overdispersion or spatial correlation in the disease data, that has not been accounted for by the available covariate information. The random effects are typically modelled by a conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior distribution, and a number of alternative specifications have been proposed. This paper critiques four of the most common models within the CAR class, and assesses their appropriateness via a simulation study. The four models are then applied to a new study mapping cancer incidence in Greater Glasgow, Scotland, between 2001 and 2005.},

  abstract = {Despite being a preventable and curable disease, tuberculosis (TB) is still a major global health threat and the second leading cause of death due to an infectious agent worldwide. All the efforts invested to end TB have resulted overall in rather slow decreases in TB incidence and mortality rates, which have been further negatively affected by the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. While the majority of targets of the End TB Strategy remain off track, and we have not yet overcome the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, recent conflicts such as the ongoing war in Ukraine are threatening the decrease of the burden of TB even further. To get back on track and get closer to ending TB, we need urgent, global, well-structured and committed multi-sectoral actions that go beyond national and global TB programmes with the support of deep investments in research and facilitation of equitable and rapid implementation of innovation worldwide., Although preventable and curable, TB is still a major global health threat. The recent \#COVID19 pandemic and other conflicts have left an unsettling scenario for \#TB. We need urgent, united and effective multi-sectoral responses to \#EndTB. https://bit.ly/40gpBrG},
